# Absenteeism Analytics Project

## Description
The Absenteeism Analytics project is a data-driven analysis and prediction project focused on understanding and forecasting employee absenteeism patterns in a workplace. By leveraging advanced data preprocessing techniques, conducting thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating insightful visualizations, and building accurate predictive models, this project aims to provide valuable insights and tools for HR professionals, managers, and decision-makers.

## Project Goals
- Analyze employee absenteeism data to identify key patterns, trends, and factors influencing absenteeism in the workplace.
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between various features, such as demographics, work-related factors, and health-related factors, with employee absenteeism.
- Build predictive models that can accurately forecast future absenteeism based on historical data and relevant features.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve employee attendance, productivity, and well-being.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and addressing data inconsistencies.
   - Conduct feature engineering and transformation to extract relevant information from the raw data.
   - Normalize or standardize features as necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the data and identify basic patterns and distributions.
   - Explore correlations and relationships between different features using statistical measures and visualizations.
   - Uncover potential outliers or anomalies in the data.
   - Identify any significant factors that may contribute to absenteeism.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Create informative and visually appealing plots, charts, and graphs to present key findings from the EDA.
   - Illustrate trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
   - Highlight important factors and insights related to absenteeism.

4. Predictive Modeling:
   - Select appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the nature of the problem and available data.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the predictive models using the training data.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
   - Fine-tune and optimize the models to achieve better accuracy and generalization.
   - Here we have deployed only a linear regression model with carefully selected features based on EDA performed.


## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing historical records of employee absenteeism, including various demographic information, work-related factors (e.g., distance from home, number of work hours), and health-related factors (e.g., body mass index, number of children). The dataset is provided in CSV format and will be loaded and processed using Python's Pandas library.
